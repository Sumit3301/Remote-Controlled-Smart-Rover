# On the communication system used for the rover  
  

We will be using SSH as the means of communicating to over rover. It allows for a secure communication path between two devices, in this case a laptop and RPi on the rover. Furthermore, it will allow us to exchange files via SCP and create new programs and modify old ones. This increases the usefulness of the rover.
